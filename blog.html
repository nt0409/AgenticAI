The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections have concluded with the Mahayuti coalition emerging victorious, winning over 230 seats. This landslide win has given a clear verdict on which Shiv Sena and NCP are genuine, according to Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Speaking at an event in Pune to distribute sanction letters and first instalments to beneficiaries under PMAY 'Gramin' (Phase-2), Shah praised the people of Maharashtra for their clear mandate. "The people of Maharashtra have given a historic mandate, delivering a clear verdict on which Shiv Sena and which NCP are genuine," he said.

Shah also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for India's development. "PM Modi has set two 'challenges' for the country - one is to make India a developed nation by 2047 and the other is to make India a five trillion economy by 2027," Shah said. He added that under PMAY-Urban 2.0, Maharashtra has been allotted the highest number of houses, with arrangements made to ensure timely provision.

The event was attended by several dignitaries, including Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar. In a related development, Sanjay Raut sought explanation from the organisers of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan regarding remarks made by Neelam Gorhe targeting Shiv Sena UBT.

Raut wrote to Sahitya Sammelan chairperson Usha Tambe, claiming that it appeared that the event was "held under political pressure". He also stated that if the programmes were not organised with proper approval from the Sahitya Mandal, an apology should be issued for hosting these events.
