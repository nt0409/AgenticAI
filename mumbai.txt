Sanjay Raut sought explanation from the organisers of the 98th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Delhi regarding remarks made by Shiv Sena’s Neelam Gorhe targeting the Shiv Sena UBT. Gorhe, who is the deputy chairperson of Maharashtra Legislative Council, had claimed that posts in Shiv Sena UBT were attained through monetary means, including gifts like Mercedes cars, news agency PTI reported. Raut wrote to Sahitya Sammelan chairperson Usha Tambe, claiming that it appeared that the event was “held under political pressure”. While stating that the platform was “grossly misused”, Raut said that if the programmes were not organised with proper approval from the Sahitya Mandal, an apology should be issued for hosting these events.

Government exploring compensation for farmers who lost livestock to stray dog attacks: Minister Muthusamy

- February 22, 2025 07:08 pm IST - Erode

The Government is exploring the possibility of providing compensation to farmers who lost their livestock to stray dog attacks, said Minister for Housing and Urban Development S. Muthusamy on Saturday.

Speaking at an awareness event in Erode on livestock protection from stray dog attacks, Mr. Muthusamy stated that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has been informed of the issue, and discussions are underway to assess the feasibility of financial aid. At present, financial assistance is provided only in cases of natural disasters, with no provision for losses caused by stray dog attacks.

He further noted that Perundurai, Kanjikoil, and Tiruppur areas have witnessed a surge in stray dog attacks on livestock, particularly over the last six months.

As a preventive measure, the government is testing an iron fence designed to protect livestock. A model of the fence was showcased near Periyar Nagar in Erode city, where the minister inspected its features and explained its benefits to farmers and the public.

“If proven effective, the system will be recommended for wider adoption, and a report on the trial results will be submitted to the Chief Minister. However, no subsidy has been approved for installing the fence, which costs approximately ₹60,000,” the Minister said.
